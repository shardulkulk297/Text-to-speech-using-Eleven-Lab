First Create Your account on: https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-lab

Here use model id for example: "model_id": "eleven_multilingual_v2" 

In order to use our API you need to get your xi-api-key first. Create an account, log in and in the lower left corner click on your profile picture -> “Profile + API key”.
Next click on the eye icon on your profile to access your xi-api-key. Do not show your account to anyone else. If someone gains access to your xi-api-key he can use your account as he could if he knew your password.
You can generate a new xi-api-key at any time by clicking on the spinning arrows next to the text field. This will invalidate your old xi-api-key.
